#Using amberenergy

= Usage =

This program is really very simple. The syntax is:
 amberenergy.x prmtop mdcrd[.gz]

The program will then read the useful information from the prmtop file (atom charges, LJ coefficients) and read the trajectories, one step at time, into memory and process them.

The energy computation is also very simple:

For electrostatics:

 * Elec = (qi.qj) / (D.r) , remember that in amber charge format the charges are already multiplied by 18.33, so that the above equation directly gives the electrostatics energy.

 * VDW = Lennard Jones potential is applied according to the rules defined in Amber.

 * Nonbonded energy = Ele+VDW
